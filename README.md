# selectiontest
## Introduction
This repository contains python modules and scripts to support testing for selective neutrality using relative likelihood. It enables application of the methods described in Simon and Huttley A New Statistical Test Provides Evidence of Selection Against Deleterious Mutations in Genes Promoting Disease Resistance (in preparation). For other software supporting that paper, but not required for applications, see https://github.com/helmutsimon/NeutralityTest.
